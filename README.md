# liquidity.js
A data visualization library for depicting quantities as animated liquid blobs.

For a demonstration of what the final product can look like, watch this video.

The animation can be rendered in real-time using circles sprites, or rendered for video output using Marching Cubes (metaballs), which is too computation-heavy to be animated in real time.

The first in-progress prototype to use the technique is Philly Contracts, but a more stripped down project in planned to serve as a boiler plate. Philly Contracts was supported

This project is its early stage.
